          <h2 className="mt-5 fw-semibold">2. General Conditions of Service</h2>

          <h5 className="fw-bold mt-3">2.1. Engagement and Scope</h5>
          <p>
            All services provided to the Client by ANG Indesign shall be
            governed by a separate, formal written proposal, statement of work
            (SOW), or service agreement. In the event of any conflict between
            these general Terms and a specific, signed SOW, the terms of the SOW
            shall prevail regarding the specific Project.
          </p>

          <h5 className="fw-bold mt-3">2.2. Client Cooperation</h5>
          <p>
            The Client agrees to provide timely access to necessary premises,
            information, feedback, and approvals (e.g., material selections,
            design sign-offs) required for ANG Indesign to complete the Project.
            Delays caused by the Client's failure to provide timely input may
            result in adjusted timelines and, potentially, additional charges as
            outlined in the SOW.
          </p>

          <h5 className="fw-bold mt-3">2.3. Project Delays and Suspension</h5>
          <p>
            If a Project is significantly delayed due to Client actions or
            inaction (e.g., failure to provide approvals or site access) for a
            period exceeding thirty (30) days, ANG Indesign reserves the right
            to suspend work and invoice the Client for all services and
            procurement activities completed up to the date of suspension.
            Resumption of work will be scheduled based on ANG Indesign’s current
            availability and may incur a project restart fee.

          <p>
            All fees for services are defined in the written proposal or SOW
            provided to the Client. ANG Indesign reserves the right to charge
            additional fees for out-of-scope work requested by the Client, which
            will be documented and approved by the Client in writing prior to
            commencement.
          </p>

          <h5 className="fw-bold mt-3">3.2. Payment Schedule and Invoicing</h5>
          <p>
            Payment schedules will be detailed in the SOW. The Client agrees to
            pay invoices within the specified timeframe. Procurement funds for
            materials and furnishings must be received in full before orders are
            placed.
          </p>

          <h5 className="fw-bold mt-3">3.3. Late Payments</h5>
          <p>
            Invoices unpaid beyond the agreed-upon due date may be subject to a
            late fee of [Insert Percentage]% per month or the maximum rate
            permitted by law, whichever is lower. ANG Indesign reserves the
            right to suspend all services, including design work and site
            visits, until all outstanding invoices are settled.
          </p>

          <h5 className="fw-bold mt-3">3.4. Termination and Refunds</h5>
          <p>
            In the event the Client terminates the Project before completion,
            the Client agrees to pay for all work completed and expenses
            incurred (including non-cancellable material orders) by ANG Indesign
            up to the date of termination. Fees paid for work already completed
            are non-refundable.
